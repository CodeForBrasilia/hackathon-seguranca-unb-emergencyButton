# Alert Me - Hackathon Segurança UnB
University of Brasília Hackathon - Hacking for a safe Campus

This little project was developed in less than 24 hours during a University of Brasília Hackathon with Safety and Security theme.

Alert Me objetive is to be an efficient "panic/emergency button" - without a button or any uncommon hardware!
Instead of opening an App for calling for help (slow process), the user can simply keep the app open with a headphone plug plugged while crossing a dangerous path (there are a lot in University of Brasília Campus).
If the user feels unsafe, he/she unplugs the headphone and a deactivation counter will start.
Once the counter reachs X seconds, if the user does not deactivate the app, it sends GPS location, hour and user info to a server and to a list of contacts defined.
